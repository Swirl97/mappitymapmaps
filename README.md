# Using Mapbox to Create Map Tiles
These tiles are of the Starbucks in the United States with data from 2017 by **carto.com**
 
Geographic Area: United States of America
Zoom Level: 1-5 on QGIS

Side Note: There was a bunch of data I had but, I think it worked out okay?
Also I don't know how to remove multiple files off my github respository without single-handedly removing them so I left my mistakes behind
